# Introduction

ZMK-Nice is a fork of Nice Keyboards Nice!60 default keymap and firmware manipulated to best suit my preferred keyboard layout (i.e., HHKB). 

## Installation

1. Download the latest firmware from the release tab
2. Unpack the directory and locate the zmk.uf2 file
3. Enable mounting of the Nice!60; double-press the reset button. Be sure the board is not plugged into the host as it will fail to mount.
4. Drag and drop the zmk.uf2 file from the host onto the Nice60!.
